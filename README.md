# Jagester-Restriction
Restricted permanently, although i'm legit.
Hello, My name is Jagester and i am from Australia, I have been playing osu! for 3 years and 6 months (made my account on the 7th of April 2015, i have a total playcount of 113065 currently and a total playtime of 1753 hours. 
for most of the time i have played i was held back severely by my equipment (keyboard, mouse.) i dont quite remember what the keyboard was called but i obtained it around the end of 2015, it was a mechanical keyboard with red switches and no RGB lighting made by Cougar. with that keyboard i couldn't play hardrock because the clicks weren't precise enough and lack of accuracy would get me killed by the drain (highest accuracy i ever got with that keyboard with hr was about 94%). The mouse i used was a Rival 100 from Steelseries (dont remember exactly when i obtained this mouse, although it was quite early in the years that i played.), which worked but the sensor wasnt very accurate and the mouse drifted quite a lot (meaning i couldnt just rely on my muscle memory to hit jumps or follow fast sliders). I upgraded my mouse first around early 2018 i believe, which was the Rival 600, a much better mouse than the Rival 100 although i felt there could be improvement still, the sensor was much more accurate although not quite what i was looking for. So at this point i was using the Cougar keyboard from late 2015 and the Rival 600 from early 2018, i had this setup up until September 2018 when i decided i wanted to upgrade my keyboard to test whether or not it would change anything (my accuracy etc, but mostly because i was sick of the Cougar keyboard.), i ended up buying the APEX M750 TKL with red switches, obtaining this keyboard felt like a blessing, all of a sudden i could get 99% accuracy with hdhr, sometimes even close to an SS, i got to about rank 2.5k with that old setup in 3 years playing just HD and HDDT getting shit accuracy across the board, i would be happy if i got 97% acc on OD8, my account accuracy was something along the lines of 96.40% but when i got this new keyboard, since i could get such high accuracy i just played HDHR for about a week straight, mixing HDDT and sometimes if the map was too hard for HDHR then just HD, i went from pretty much spot on rank 2.5k to the top 500 in about 8-10 days. all the while i was switching out between my Rival 600 and a shitty Wacom tablet that i have, because the Rival 600 would drift to much, so i decided to try and find the best mouse for me, i ended up finding a mouse called the Roccat Kova (i obtained the Roccat Kova on the 12th of October) which much like the APEX felt like a blessing, the sensor felt more precise, barely drifted when playing high spacing jump maps etc. So now i have the Steelseries APEX M750 TKL keyboard and the Roccat Kova, since i could click precisely it felt easier to aim a lot of things (almost as if it upgraded my hand eye coordination), and the Roccat Kova had little to none mouse drift matched with a very precise sensor meaning i could rely on my muscle memory to hit stuff. I became very consistent now that i had upgraded my equipment.
My peak rank was 415 or 416, one of the two, i was just playing the game trying to become as good as i could get. The last time i played online was October 28th, woke up the next morning only to see a big scary message saying "ALERT, your account has been restricted." of course i freaked out, i sent an email to osu!support questioning the restriction (because i'm legit.). I got an email back stating that its a permanent restriction and i am allowed to make an appeal in 3 months, and the reasoning for the permanent restriction is supposedly "Your account has been observed engaging in cheating behaviour",this is simply not true, I value my account to much to throw it away by cheating. when you dump as many hours as i have into a game (i play osu! sometimes 12 hours a day, not to mention i am too much of a scaredy cat to break any rules.
I am proud of all of the plays i have made! (BECAUSE I AM LEGIT)
